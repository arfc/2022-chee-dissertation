# AHTR Plank Optimization, Simulation p-1a

The results are presented in Section 6.2.1 of the dissertation. 

This optimization simulation was run on the Bluewaters supercomputer using the `run` bash script. 
The CLI output from Bluewaters is printed in `run.o13562143`. 

The `run` bash script uses ROLLO to run the following input file `rollo_min_pf.json`, which also utilizes the following evaluator scripts:  `fhr_plank_openmc.py` and `fhr_plank_openmc_keff.py`.
