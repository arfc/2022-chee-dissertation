# AHTR Plank Optimization 

The results are presented in Chapters 5 and 6 of the dissertation. 

`plank_computational_cost.ipynb` summarizes the Theta computational cost taken by each plank optimization problem. 

`/verification/` provides data and results for the AHTR plank verification studies conducted in Chapter 5. 

`/single-obj/`, `/two-obj/`, and `/three-obj/` provide the data and results for the AHTR plank optimization simulations conducted in Chapter 6. 

Reproducing the results generated in this directory requires installation of the following software: 

```
