# AHTR One-Third Optimization 

The results are presented in Chapters 5 and 7 of the dissertation. 

`computational_cost_assem.ipynb` summarizes the Theta computational cost taken by each one-third assembly optimization problem. 

`find_out_pf.ipynb` calculates the packing fraction in the one-third assembly problem. 

`htc_calc_one_third_assem.ipynb` calculates the heat transfer coefficient for the one-third assembly's Moltres temperature model. 

`/verification/` provides data and results for the AHTR plank verification studies conducted in Chapter 5. 

`/single-obj/`, `/two-obj/`, and `/three-obj/` provide the data and results for the AHTR plank optimization simulations conducted in Chapter 6.
