    \textbf{Additive manufacturing will radically transform reactor design.}
    \vspace{0.5cm}

    For this dissertation, I successfully
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Furthered our understanding of the \gls{AHTR} design's complexities 
        through neutronics and thermal-hydraulics modeling 
        \item Created an open-source tool that enables nuclear reactor design 
        evolutionary algorithm optimization for non-conventional reactor geometries and fuel 
        distributions
        \item Applied the optimization tool to the \gls{AHTR} design 
    \end{enumerate}
