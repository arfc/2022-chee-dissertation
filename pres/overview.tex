    \textbf{Additive manufacturing could radically transform reactor design.}
    \vspace{0.5cm}

    I propose to: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Model the Fluoride-Salt-Cooled High-Temperature Reactor's (FHR)
        neutronics and thermal-hydraulics and participate in the FHR benchmark
        \item Design an optimization tool that generates new 3D-printing enabled 
        optimal reactor designs
        \item Use optimization tool to generate optimal non-conventional 
        FHR designs
    \end{itemize}
