    \textbf{Additive manufacturing will radically transform reactor design.}
    \begin{block}{Research Objectives: AHTR Model Development}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Further our understanding of the AHTR design's complexities 
            through neutronics and thermal-hydraulics modeling
            \item Participate in the OECD-NEA's FHR Benchmark
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Research Objectives: AHTR optimization for non-conventional designs}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Develop an open-source tool that applies evolutionary algorithms with established 
            nuclear software to optimize reactor design
            \item Demonstrate successful application of the optimization tool 
            for single and multi-objective AHTR optimization of 
            non-conventional geometries and fuel distribution
        \end{itemize}
