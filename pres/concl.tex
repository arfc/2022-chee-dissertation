        \begin{itemize}
            \item The triple heterogeneity introduced by the geometrically complex 
            fuel assembly design makes accurate reactor physics simulations challenging
        \end{itemize}
        Results Presented 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item FHR benchmark phase I-A and I-B results
            \item AHTR full assembly temperature model 
        \end{itemize}
        Major Takeaways 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item AHTR has passive safety behavior with negative temperature coeffcients
            \item Increased fuel packing does not always correspond with increased 
            $k_{eff}$ due to self-shielding effects 
            \item AHTR temperature peaks in the fuel stripes near the spacers 
        \end{itemize}

    Through participation in the FHR benchmark, this dissertation contributes to 
    \textbf{deepening our understanding} of the promising \gls{AHTR} technology.

    \begin{block}{ROLLO Tool Development and AHTR Non-Conventional Design Optimization}
        Relevance
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Optimization tools for generating new reactor designs enabled by
            3D printing do not exist
            \item Reactor optimization for non-conventional geometries and parameters 
            has not been done 
        \end{itemize}
        Results Presented
        Major Takeaways 
    \end{block}

    By designing the \gls{ROLLO} tool and demonstrating \gls{ROLLO}'s success in 
    optimization of the \gls{AHTR} beyond classical input parameters, this dissertation 
    contributes to optimization tool development for reactors of the future.
