        Relevance
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The triple heterogeneity introduced by the geometrically complex 
            fuel assembly design makes accurate reactor physics simulations challenging
        \end{itemize}
        Results Presented 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item FHR benchmark phase I-A and I-B results
            \item AHTR full assembly temperature model 
        \end{itemize}
        Major Takeaways 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item AHTR has passive safety behavior with negative temperature coeffcients
            \item Increased fuel packing does not always correspond with increased 
            $k_{eff}$ due to self-shielding effects 
            \item AHTR temperature peaks in the fuel stripes near the spacers 
        \end{itemize}

    Through participation in the \gls{FHR} benchmark, this dissertation contributes to 
    \textbf{deepening our understanding} of the promising \gls{AHTR} technology.
