    \begin{block}{Technical Gap}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Optimization tools for generating new reactor designs enabled by
        3D printing do not exist
        \item Reactor optimization for non-conventional geometries and parameters 
        has not been done 
      \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Proposed Work Component II: Reactor optimization for
      non-conventional designs}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Develop a tool that applies evolutionary algorithms with established 
            nuclear software to optimize reactor design
            \item Demonstrate successful implementation of the optimization tool 
            with OpenMC for single and multi-objective AHTR optimization of 
            non-conventional geometries and fuel distribution
