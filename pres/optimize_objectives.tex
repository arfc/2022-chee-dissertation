      \begin{itemize}
        \item Optimization tools for generating new reactor designs enabled by
        3D printing do not exist
        \item Reactor optimization for non-conventional geometries and parameters 
        has not been done

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Develop an open-source tool that applies evolutionary algorithms with established 
            nuclear software to optimize reactor design
            \item Demonstrate successful application of the optimization tool 
            for single and multi-objective AHTR optimization of 
            non-conventional geometries and fuel distribution
