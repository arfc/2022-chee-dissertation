  \begin{block}{Technical Gap}
      The triple heterogeneity introduced by the geometrically complex 
      fuel assembly design makes accurate reactor physics simulations challenging. 
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Research Objectives: AHTR Model Development}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Further our understanding of the AHTR design's complexities 
      through neutronics and thermal-hydraulics modeling
      \item Participate in the OECD-NEA's FHR Benchmark 
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Link to Reactor Optimization for Non-conventional Designs}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item By participating in the benchmark, I ensure an accurate AHTR base model
    \item Thus, I can expect accurate answers for the optimized AHTR designs
  \end{itemize}
