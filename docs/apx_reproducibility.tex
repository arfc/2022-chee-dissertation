\chapter{Appendix xx: Reproducibility} 

Reproducible science refers to the concept that all research outputs should be 
repeatable using a complete computational environment consisting of the software 
application, input files, and data results \cite{novak_multiscale_2020}.
This section describes the complete computational environment used to obtain the 
results in this dissertation.

The UIUC team's \gls{FHR} benchmark results is hosted on Github at 
\begin{equation*}
\mbox{\url{https://github.com/arfc/fhr-benchmark}}
\end{equation*}
Instructions on how to reproduce the benchmark results are included in READMEs within 
the \texttt{fhr-benchmark} directory. 

The \gls{ROLLO} project is hosted on Github at 
\begin{equation*}
    \mbox{\url{https://github.com/arfc/rollo}}
\end{equation*}
Instructions on how to install the \gls{ROLLO} Python package and documentation are 
provided in the README. 

The Latex source files and figures used to compile this dissertation document 
are available on Github at
