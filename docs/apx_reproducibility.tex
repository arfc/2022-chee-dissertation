\chapter{Appendix xx: Reproducibility} 

Reproducible science refers to the concept that all research outputs should be 
repeatable using a complete computational environment consisting of the software 
application, input files, and data results \cite{novak_multiscale_2020}.
This section describes the complete computational environment used to obtain the 
results in this dissertation.
