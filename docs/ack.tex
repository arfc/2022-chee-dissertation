For this dissertation and all I have learnt from my years in graduate school, 
I am deeply grateful to many amazing professors and colleagues at the University of 
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, as well as Argonne National Laboratory. 
% Huff, Munk 
I want to express my deepest gratitudes to my advisors, Dr. Kathryn Huff and Dr. 
Madicken Munk. 
I am grateful to Professor Huff for her unconditional support over the years, and for 
giving me so much freedom in pursuing my research as I found my footing in the early 
years of graduate school. 
I am especially grateful for her ability to inspire me to look at the bigger picture of 
my work, and holding to me to a high standard in all aspects.
I am grateful to Dr. Munk for her kindness, encouragement, and guidance in my final year 
of graduate school, as I wrote this dissertation. 
Her enthusiasm with discussing results, and her experience and insights challenged me to 
gain a deeper understanding, appreciation, and intuition for reactor physics.  

I would also like to thank the professors who served in my committee: Dr. Tomasz 
Kozlowski, Dr. James Stubbins, and Dr. Huy Trong Tran, for the knowledge and guidance 
they provided, and for assessing this work.
