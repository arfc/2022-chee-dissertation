For this dissertation and all I have learnt from my years in graduate school, 
I am deeply grateful to many amazing professors and colleagues at the University of 
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, as well as Argonne National Laboratory. 
% Huff, Munk 
I want to express my deepest gratitudes to my advisors, Dr. Kathryn Huff and Dr. 
Madicken Munk. 
I am grateful to Professor Huff for her unconditional support over the years, and for 
giving me so much freedom in pursuing my research as I found my footing in the early 
years of graduate school. 
I am especially grateful for her ability to inspire me to look at the bigger picture of 
my work, holding to me to a high standard in all aspects, and the care she showed 
her students. 
I am grateful to Dr. Munk for her encouragement and guidance in my final year 
of graduate school, as I wrote this dissertation. 
Her enthusiasm with discussing results, and her experience and insights led me to 
gain a deeper understanding and intuition for the reactor physics.
