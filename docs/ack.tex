For this dissertation and all I have learnt from my years in graduate school, 
I am deeply grateful to many amazing professors and colleagues at the University of 
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, as well as Argonne National Laboratory. 
% Huff, Munk 
I want to express my deepest gratitudes to my advisors, Dr. Kathryn Huff and Dr. 
Madicken Munk. 
I am grateful to Professor Huff for her unconditional support over the years, and for 
giving me so much freedom in pursuing my research as I found my footing in the early 
years of graduate school. 
I am especially grateful for her ability to inspire me to look at the bigger picture of 
my work, and holding me to a high standard in all aspects.
I am grateful to Dr. Munk for her guidance and encouragement in my final year 
of graduate school, as I wrote this dissertation. 
Her enthusiasm with discussing results, and her experience and insights challenged me to 
gain a deeper understanding, intuition, and appreciation for reactor physics.  
I would also like to thank the professors who served in my committee: Dr. Tomasz 
Kozlowski, Dr. James Stubbins, and Dr. Huy Trong Tran, for the knowledge and guidance 
they provided, and for assessing this work. 
I also wish to thank my Argonne internship advisors, Dr. Bo Feng and Dr. Adam Nelson, 
for their technical and practical guidance. 

I am thankful for the friendship of my fellow Advanced Reactors and Fuel Cycles 
groupmates who not only made great colleagues and collaborators, but also made 
grad school fun -- Sun Myung Park, Greg Westphal, Jin Whan Bae, Anshuman Chaube, 
Dr. Andrei Rykhlevkii, Sam Dotson, Nathan Ryan, Lu Kissinger, Amanda Bachmann, 
Nataly Panczyk, Olek Yardas, Luke Seifert, and Zoe Ritcher. 
Special thanks to Nathan Ryan and Nataly Panczyk for their excellent proofreading 
and comments on this work.
