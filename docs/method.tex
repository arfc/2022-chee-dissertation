\chapter{AHTR Modeling and Optimization Methodology}
In this chapter, I describe the modeling and optimization methodology of
\gls{ROLLO} \gls{AHTR} optimization for non-conventional geometries and parameters.
To wholly explore the design space enabled by additive manufacturing, the 
optimization tool should enable placement of fuel, moderation, and coolant material 
in any possible location, within physical limits. 
Since exploration of non-conventional geometries and parameters has barely been
attempted (previous attempts described in Section \ref{sec:lit-review-reactor-arbitrary}), 
this dissertation attempts a first go at beginning to explore the large design space.  
The work done for this dissertation is only an intermediate step towards developing 
a truly arbitrary geometry expression. 

%In the subsequent sections, I will define the optimization problem, describe the 
%AHTR geometries . 
%Then, I will describe the software used to model them and the specific models. 

\section{Optimization Problem Definition}
In an effort towards optimizing reactor design for non-conventional geometries 
and parameters.
I chose to vary the following \gls{AHTR} parameters: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \gls{TRISO} particle packing fraction distribution, 
    $\rho_{TRISO}(\vec{r})$
    \item Total fuel packing fraction
    \item \gls{FLiBe} coolant channel shape 
\end{itemize} 
The TRISO packing fraction distribution variation enables exploration of how 
heterogenous fuel distributions impact reactor performance.
In Chapter \ref{chap:fhr-benchmark}, the results demonstrated that increased fuel 
packing does not always correspond with increased $k_{eff}$ due to self-shielding
effects. 
Varying total fuel packing fraction and TRISO distribution synergistically enables exploration of
how TRISO distribution could minimize self-shielding and in turn reduce the fuel 
required in a reactor design. 
The FliBe coolant channel shape variation enables exploration of how non-uniform 
channel shapes impact reactor performance. 

I selected three key \gls{AHTR} optimization objectives that address contrasting reactor 
core qualities. 
Table \ref{tab:objectives} describes each objective, how I quantified them, and the motivation.

    \begin{tabular}{p{4cm}p{5cm}p{5cm}}
    \hline 
    \textbf{Objective}& \textbf{Quantification}& \textbf{Motivation} \\
    \hline
    Minimize fuel amount & Minimize total fuel packing fraction & Cost savings, Non-proliferation \\ 
    \hline
    Maximize heat transfer & Minimize maximum temperature & Enable system to perform at a higher power with minimized thermal stress \\
    \hline
    Minimize power peaking & Minimize power peaking factor normalized by fuel distribution & Efficient fuel utilization, longer core life, safety\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
I will vary the described parameters in the \gls{AHTR} plank and \gls{AHTR} one-third assembly 
geometries to optimize the described objectives. 
The plank optimization acts as a preliminary study to inform the more complex \gls{AHTR} one-third
assembly optimization setup. 
In the next section, I will describe both geometries. 

\section{AHTR Geometry for Optimization Problem}
The optimization process is applied to both the \gls{AHTR} plank and \gls{AHTR} one-third
assembly geometries.
The geometries are adapted from the \gls{AHTR} design in the \gls{FHR} benchmark,
outlined in Chapter \ref{chap:fhr-benchmark}.
The main differences occur in the fuel plank region (see Figure \ref{fig:ahtr-fuel-assembly}). 
In the \gls{FHR} benchmark, the TRISO particles are arranged in rectangular lattices within
two fuel stripes in the plank. 
For the optimization problem, I instead discretized each plank into ten cells with random 
TRISO packing and an individually controlled packing fraction. 
I also omit the graphite spacers. 

\subsection{AHTR Plank Geometry}
\label{sec:ahtr-plank-geometry}
The \gls{AHTR} plank is a single graphite fuel plank model from the \gls{AHTR} design (Figure 
\ref{fig:ahtr-fuel-assembly}). 
I modified the fuel plank to be straightened with perpendicular sides, instead 
of slanted as in Figure \ref{fig:ahtr-fuel-plank}, for ease of modeling. 
The original slanted \gls{AHTR} geometry will be used for the complex one-third assembly 
optimization setup. 
Figure \ref{fig:straightened_plank} illustrates the straightened fuel plank with 
ten fuel cells with random \gls{TRISO} packing.

    \caption{Straightened \acrfull{AHTR} fuel plank with 10 fuel cells with random 
    TRISO packing. Original slanted fuel planks can be seen in Figures 
    \ref{fig:ahtr-fuel-assembly} and \ref{fig:ahtr-fuel-plank}.}
    \label{fig:straightened_plank}
\end{figure}
The plank has $27.1 \times 3.25 \times 1.85\ cm^3$ dimensions with reflective 
boundary conditions.

I used the same materials as in the \gls{FHR} benchmark (Chapter \ref{chap:fhr-benchmark}), 
except that I homogenized each \gls{TRISO} particle's four outer layers: 
porous carbon buffer, inner pyrolytic carbon, silicon carbide layer, and the 
outer pyrolytic carbon. 
The \gls{TRISO} particle dimensions remain the same.
Table \ref{tab:keff_triso} reports OpenMC's reported $k_{eff}$ for this original 
straightened \gls{AHTR} configuration with and without the outer layer \gls{TRISO} 
homogenization.
\begin{table}[]
    \centering
    \onehalfspacing
    \caption{Straightened \acrfull{AHTR} fuel plank $k_{eff}$ for case with 
    no \gls{TRISO} homogenization and case with homogenization of the four outer 
    layers. Both simulations were run on one BlueWaters XE Node.}

    \footnotesize
    \begin{tabular}{llc}
    \hline 
    \textbf{TRISO Homogenization}& \textbf{$k_{eff}$} & \textbf{Simulation time [s]}  \\
    \hline 
    None & $1.38548 \pm 0.00124$ & 233\\ 
    Four outer layers & $1.38625 \pm 0.00109$ & 168\\ 
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
The \gls{TRISO} particle outer four-layer homogenization resulted in a $30\%$ 
speed-up without compromising accuracy with $k_{eff}$ values within each 
other's uncertainty.

\subsection{AHTR One-Third Assembly Geometry}
The \gls{AHTR} one-third assembly is one-diamond shape sector of the \gls{AHTR} assembly which
contains six fuel planks.
Each graphite plank has graphite buffers and ten rectangular prism fuel cells 
with random TRISO packing and individually controlled packing fraction. 
Figure \ref{fig:ahtr_assembly} shows the one-third \gls{AHTR} assembly with 10 x 6 fuel cells with 
random \gls{TRISO} packing.

           \tkzText[above](-0.3,-0.7){}

            \textcolor{fhrblue}{$\blacksquare$} & FLiBe \\
            \textcolor{fhrgrey}{$\blacksquare$} & Graphite (Fuel Plank)\\
            \textcolor{fhrred}{$\blacksquare$} & Graphite (Fuel Stripe) \\

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{\gls{AHTR} assembly with 10 fuel cells in each graphite plank with random 
    TRISO packing. Original \gls{FHR} benchmark fuel assembly with fuel stripes can be seen in 
    Figure \ref{fig:ahtr-fuel-assembly}.}
    \label{fig:ahtr_assembly}
\end{figure}
The assembly model also uses the \gls{TRISO} particle outer four layer homogenization described 
in Section \ref{sec:ahtr-plank-geometry}.

\section{AHTR Model Workflow}
\gls{ROLLO} drives the evolutionary algorithm optimization process. 
In the \gls{ROLLO} input file, I will define control variables for the genetic algorithm 
to vary. 
These control variables will be input into templated nuclear software to model different 
AHTR geometries.
The software will calculate the optimization objective and constraint values. 

In this section, I describe the \gls{AHTR} modeling workflow: from the AHTR geometry 
variation input parameters, to the OpenMC and Moltres models, and finally the 
output and constraint values.
