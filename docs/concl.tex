\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{chap:concl}

Additive manufacturing of reactor core components removes the geometric constraints 
of conventional manufacturing, and will reduce reactor fabrication costs, 
deployment timelines, and improve reactor safety. 
Reactor optimization for arbitrary geometries enabled by additive manufacturing is a 
new concept, and few research demonstrations have been done to explore the large 
new design space.
