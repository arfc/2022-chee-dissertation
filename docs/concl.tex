Additive manufacturing of reactor core components removes the geometric constraints
required by conventional manufacturing. 
This reduces reactor fabrication costs, deployment timelines, and improves reactor 
safety. 
Fully benefitting from the new ability to 3D print reactor components, requires further 
research into reactor generative design optimization. 
This dissertation explores this new design space by designing and applying the flexible 
and open-source \gls{ROLLO} tool to optimize the \gls{AHTR} for non-conventional 
geometries and parameters. 
I successfully explored the \gls{AHTR}'s arbitrary geometry design space by completing 
these three dissertation objectives: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item I furthered our understanding of the \gls{AHTR} design's complexities 
    through neutronics and thermal-hydraulics modeling by participating in the 
    \gls{OECD} \gls{NEA} \gls{FHR} benchmark. 
    \item I created the open-source \gls{ROLLO} tool that enables nuclear reactor design 
    evolutionary algorithm optimization for non-conventional reactor geometries and fuel 
    distributions
    \item I applied \gls{ROLLO} to optimize the \gls{AHTR} plank and one-third assembly
    designs by varying fuel amounts, fuel distributions, and coolant channel shapes to 
    minimize three key reactor performance metrics: total fuel amount, maximum 
    temperature, and fuel-normalized power peaking factor. 
\end{enumerate}
