Additive manufacturing of reactor core components removes the geometric constraints
required by conventional manufacturing. 
This reduces reactor fabrication costs, deployment timelines, and improves reactor 
safety. 
Fully benefitting from the new ability to 3D print reactor components, requires further 
research into reactor generative design optimization. 
This dissertation explores this new design space by designing and applying the flexible 
and open-source \gls{ROLLO} tool to optimize the \gls{AHTR} for non-conventional 
geometries and parameters. 
I successfully explored the \gls{AHTR}'s arbitrary geometry design space by completing 
these three dissertation objectives: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item I furthered our understanding of the \gls{AHTR} design's complexities 
    through neutronics and thermal-hydraulics modeling by participating in the 
    \gls{OECD} \gls{NEA} \gls{FHR} benchmark.
    \item I developed the open-source \gls{ROLLO} tool that enables generative reactor 
    design evolutionary algorithm optimization for non-conventional reactor geometries 
    and fuel distributions.
    \item I applied \gls{ROLLO} to optimize the \gls{AHTR} plank and one-third assembly
    designs by varying fuel amounts, fuel distributions, and coolant channel shapes to 
    minimize three key reactor performance metrics: total fuel amount, maximum 
    temperature, and fuel-normalized power peaking factor.
\end{enumerate}
Chapter \ref{chap:fhr-benchmark} addressed objective 1, chapter \ref{chap:rollo} 
addressed objective 2, and chapters \ref{chap:method}, \ref{chap:ahtr-plank-opt-results}, 
and \ref{chap:ahtr-assem-opt-results} addressed objective 3. 

Chapter \ref{chap:fhr-benchmark} reported the \gls{FHR} benchmark Phase I-A and I-B 
results, which highlighted the \gls{AHTR}'s passive safety behavior with 
negative temperature coefficients. 
Comparison of $k_{eff}$ results between the reference case and the \gls{AHTR} 
configuration with high heavy metal loading demonstrated that increased fuel 
packing does not always correspond with increased $k_{eff}$ due to self-shielding 
effects.
Chapter \ref{chap:fhr-benchmark} also reported the \gls{AHTR} full assembly 
multiphysics model results. The temperature distribution peaks in the fuel stripes near 
the spacers, highlighting to reactor designers that spacer material and location in the 
\gls{AHTR} geometry impact temperature peaks.  

Chapter \ref{chap:rollo} described the \gls{ROLLO} optimization tool developed for this 
dissertation.
