Additive manufacturing of reactor core components removes the geometric constraints
of conventional manufacturing, which will reduce reactor fabrication costs, 
deployment timelines, and improve reactor safety. 
Fully benefitting from the new ability to 3D print reactor components, requires further 
research into optimization for arbitrary geometries. 
This dissertation explores this new design space by applying the flexible and open-source 
\gls{ROLLO} tool to optimize the \gls{AHTR} for non-conventional geometries and 
parameters.

\section{Future Work}
% characterize hyperparameter space better for FHR assem multi obj 

% further exploration of the AHTR arbitrary geometry design space. Represent as pixels? 
% or some sort of smarter expression... see structural aerospace design space. 
% especially once we have more compute time.
