Additive manufacturing of reactor core components removes the geometric constraints
of conventional manufacturing, which will reduce reactor fabrication costs, 
deployment timelines, and improve reactor safety. 
Fully benefitting from the new ability to 3D print reactor components, requires further 
research into optimization for arbitrary geometries. 
This dissertation explores this new design space by designing and applying the flexible 
and open-source \gls{ROLLO} tool to optimize the \gls{AHTR} for non-conventional 
geometries and parameters. 
Successfully exploring the \gls{AHTR}'s arbitrary geometry design space required
these three components described in the introduction: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Furthering our understanding of the \gls{AHTR} design's complexities 
    through neutronics and thermal-hydraulics modeling 
    \item Creating an open-source tool that enables nuclear reactor design 
    evolutionary algorithm optimization for non-conventional reactor geometries and fuel 
    distributions
    \item Applying the optimization tool to the \gls{AHTR} design 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Future Work}
% characterize hyperparameter space better for FHR assem multi obj 

% further exploration of the AHTR arbitrary geometry design space. Represent as pixels? 
% or some sort of smarter expression... see structural aerospace design space.
