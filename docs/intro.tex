Increased global surface temperatures, sea levels, and severe weather events 
caused by \gls{GHG} concentrations show the negative impact of 
climate change on natural and human systems \cite{noauthor_climate_2018}.  
Energy generation technology profoundly impacts climate change. 
Large-scale emissions-free nuclear power deployment could significantly reduce 
\gls{GHG} production but faces both cost and safety challenges 
\cite{noauthor_climate_2018}. 
To provide low-carbon electricity worldwide, the nuclear power industry must 
overcome cost and safety challenges to ensure continued global use and 
expansion of nuclear energy technology.
