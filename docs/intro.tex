Access to electricity plays a vital role in improving standards of living, 
education, and health around the world \cite{petti_future_2018}. 
As the human population increases and previously underdeveloped 
nations rapidly industrialize, global energy demand will continue to rise, with 
worldwide electricity use expected to grow $45\%$ by 2040 
\cite{petti_future_2018, noauthor_us_2018}.
Expanding access to energy while at the same time drastically reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions that are responsible for climate challenge 
is among the central challenges confronting humankind in the 21st century
\cite{petti_future_2018}. 
The latest scientific report by the \gls{IPCC} finds changes in the Earth's climate 
in every region and across the whole climate system \cite{noauthor_climate_2021}. 
Increased global surface temperatures, sea levels, and severe weather events 
caused by elevated \gls{GHG} concentrations show the negative impact of 
climate change on natural and human systems \cite{noauthor_climate_2018}. 
Concerted international efforts over the past 20 years have increased the amount 
of electricity generated by wind, solar and other renewable sources. 
However, they have failed to displace fossil fuels from the mix. 
In 2017, fossil fuels produced more electricity - in relative 
and absolute terms - than ever before \cite{noauthor_nuclear_nodate}.
Advancing and deploying carbon free technologies to solve climate change 
is imperative. 

Nuclear power plants produce no greenhouse gas emissions during operation. 
Throughout their life cycle, nuclear energy produces about the same amount of carbon 
dioxide-equivalent emissions per unit of electricity as wind and one-third of 
the emissions per unit of electricity when compared with solar 
\cite{noauthor_nuclear_nodate-1}.
Nuclear power provides essential base load power that complements 
renewables' variability. 
Many projections of energy portfolios in carbon-limited scenarios include 
fission power as an important contributor to the rapid decarbonization of the 
electricity sector in tandem with energy diversification objectives 
\cite{petti_future_2018, noauthor_nuclear_nodate-1}.
Large-scale emissions-free nuclear power deployment could significantly 
reduce \gls{GHG} production but faces both high upfront cost and perceived adverse 
safety challenges \cite{noauthor_climate_2018, petti_future_2018}. 
The nuclear power industry must overcome cost and safety challenges to ensure 
continued global use and expansion of nuclear energy technology to provide 
low-carbon electricity worldwide.

Wide-spread adoption of additive manufacturing methods in the nuclear industry 
could drastically reduce reactor fabrication costs and deployment timelines 
and improve reactor safety \cite{simpson_considerations_2019}. 
These reductions are achieved by combining multiple systems and assembled 
components into single parts, tailoring local material properties, and 
enabling geometry redesign for increased safety and performance 
\cite{simpson_considerations_2019}. 
Additive manufacturing (i.e., 3D printing) has progressed rapidly in the last 
30 years, from rapid design prototyping with polymers in the automotive industry 
to metal component-scale production. 
With further advancements in the material science research surrounding 
additive manufacturing technologies, a reactor core could be 3D printed within the 
next decade. 
\gls{ORNL} leads this initiative through the 2019 \gls{TCR} Demonstration Program. 
The \gls{TCR} program will 3D print a microreactor by leveraging recent scientific 
achievements in additive manufacturing, nuclear materials, machine learning, and 
computational modeling and simulation \cite{terrani_transformational_2019}.

Additive manufacturing of reactor core components removes the geometric constraints 
of conventional fuel manufacturing. 
Reactor designers are no longer limited by conventional geometric shapes that are easy 
to manufacture with traditional processes, such as slabs as fuel planks, cylinders as 
fuel rods, spheres as fuel pebbles, and axis-aligned coolant channels 
\cite{sobes_artificial_2020}. 
Fabricating reactor core components using additive manufacturing can further optimize 
and improve core geometries to enhance reactor performance and safety at lower costs 
\cite{bergeron_early_2018}.
Due to the expansion of the potential design space allowed through additive 
manufacturing, reactor designers need to find methods, such as generative 
design, to explore the design space efficiently. 
Generative design is an iterative design exploration process 
\cite{autodesk_autodesk_2020}; designers input design goals and constraints into a 
generative design software and the software explores all the possible permutations 
of a solution, quickly generating design alternatives. 
The software tests and learns from each iteration what designs works and what does not. 

Generative reactor design optimization for arbitrary geometries enabled by additive 
manufacturing is a new concept, and few research demonstrations have been done to 
explore the large new design space. 
Previous efforts include Sobes et al. \cite{sobes_artificial_2020} using genetic 
algorithms to find minimum volume geometric configurations for the TCR reactor. 
This study represented arbitrary geometry variations using right cylinders. 
Also, See et al. \cite{see_design_2022} optimized the TCR's outlet plenum design 
by varying inlet channel positioning and outer wall shape.  
The expanded design space associated with an arbitrary reactor geometry increases 
the time for reactor designers to explore and find optimal geometries. 
Instead, we can leverage \gls{AI} optimization methods, such as evolutionary algorithms, 
to rapidly explore the large design space to find global optimal designs. 
\gls{AI} does not replace the human reactor designer but shifts the human designer's 
focus away from conjecturing suitable geometries to defining design criteria to 
find optimal designs and evaluating their relative strengths \cite{sobes_artificial_2020}. 
Thus, when the human designer changes the reactor criteria, the AI model will quickly 
adapt and produce new global optimal designs to fit the new criteria.

Thoroughly exploring the design space enabled by additive manufacturing should allow 
the placement of fuel, moderation, and coolant material in any possible location 
within physical limits. 
In this dissertation, I explore the large design space while acknowledging that 
this work is only an intermediate step towards developing a truly arbitrary 
geometry expression. 
I apply evolutionary algorithms to conduct generative reactor design optimization. 
For this dissertation, I designed the \gls{ROLLO} tool \cite{chee_rollo_2021} to 
drive the evolutionary algorithm optimization process and used OpenMC 
\cite{romano_openmc:_2015} and Moltres \cite{lindsay_introduction_2018} software to 
model the reactor's neutronics and thermal-hydraulics. 
\gls{ROLLO} generates reactor designs with varying fuel amounts, fuel 
distributions, and coolant channel shapes to minimize three key reactor performance 
metrics: total fuel amount, maximum temperature, and fuel-normalized power peaking 
factor. 

In 2000, the \gls{DOE} initiated the Generation IV International Forum, which aims 
to enhance the role of nuclear energy in our global energy ecosystem by 
leading and planning research and development to support new and innovative 
Generation IV nuclear energy systems \cite{gen_iv_international_forum_technology_2014}.
Generation IV nuclear systems target goals in four areas: sustainability, 
economics, safety and reliability, and proliferation resistance and physical 
protection \cite{gen_iv_international_forum_technology_2014}. 
They identified six Generation IV systems that met these goals: \glspl{GFR}, 
\glspl{LFR}, \glspl{MSR}, \glspl{SFR}, \glspl{SCWR}, and \glspl{VHTR} 
\cite{gen_iv_international_forum_technology_2014}. 
In this dissertation, I optimize the \gls{FHR}, which combines the best aspects 
of \gls{MSR} and \gls{VHTR} Generation IV systems. 
\glspl{FHR} use high-temperature coated-particle fuel (similar to the \glspl{VHTR}) 
and a low-pressure liquid fluoride-salt coolant (similar to the \glspl{MSR})
\cite{forsberg_fluoride-salt-cooled_2012,facilitators_fluoride-salt-cooled_2013}.
This dissertation focuses on a prismatic \gls{FHR} design with hexagonal fuel 
assemblies consisting of \gls{TRISO} fuel particles embedded in planks, i.e., 
the \gls{AHTR} design.
The \emph{triple heterogeneous} \gls{AHTR} fuel, comprises of \gls{TRISO} 
particles embedded in strategically arranged plates, presents complex reactor 
physics and significant modeling challenges \cite{petrovic_benchmark_2021}. 
To further understand and address the technical challenges associated with the 
\gls{AHTR} design, I participate in the \gls{OECD}-\gls{NEA}'s \gls{FHR} 
benchmarking exercise \cite{petrovic_benchmark_2021}.

\section{Objectives and Outline}
This dissertation's content is shaped by the following three objectives: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item furthering our understanding of the \gls{AHTR} design's complexities 
    through neutronics and thermal-hydraulics modeling, 
    \item creating an open-source tool that enables nuclear reactor design 
    evolutionary algorithm optimization for non-conventional reactor geometries and fuel 
    distributions, and 
    \item applying the optimization tool to the \gls{AHTR} design. 
\end{enumerate}
Chapter \ref{chap:fhr-benchmark} addresses objective 1, chapter \ref{chap:rollo} 
addresses objective 2, and chapters \ref{chap:method}, \ref{chap:ahtr-plank-opt-results}, 
and \ref{chap:ahtr-assem-opt-results} addresses objective 3. 

Chapter \ref{chap:lit-review} presents a literature review that organizes and 
reports on previous work pertinent to all three objectives. 
I provide an overview of the \gls{FHR} concept, then detail one specific 
\gls{FHR} design: the \gls{AHTR}. 
I describe previous efforts and technical challenges of modeling the \gls{AHTR} design
and how these efforts led to the \gls{OECD} \gls{NEA}'s \gls{FHR} benchmark initiation.
Next, I outline additive manufacturing's history and describe the current 
research on using additive manufacturing for nuclear reactor component fabrication. 
I review previous nuclear reactor design optimization efforts and describe how 
additive manufacturing of nuclear reactor components enables optimization for 
less constrained reactor geometries. 
I describe optimization methods that can be leveraged to find optimal reactor 
designs in the expanded design space.
Finally, I provide a background of the evolutionary algorithms and detail a specific 
evolutionary algorithm: the genetic algorithm and how it works to conduct global 
optimization robustly.

Chapter \ref{chap:fhr-benchmark} describes the \gls{FHR} benchmark specifications and 
the \gls{UIUC} team's results.
The \gls{OECD}-\gls{NEA} and \gls{Georgia Tech} initiated the \gls{FHR} 
benchmark for the \gls{AHTR} design in 2019 \cite{petrovic_benchmark_2021} 
to address the \gls{AHTR} modeling challenges such as multiple heterogeneity and 
material cross-section data. 
\gls{UIUC} participates in the \gls{FHR} benchmark with the OpenMC Monte Carlo code 
\cite{romano_openmc_2013} and the ENDF/B-VII.1 material cross section library 
\cite{chadwick_endf/b-vii.1_2011}.
The \gls{UIUC} team consists of myself and my advisors, Professor Kathryn Huff, 
and Dr. Madicken Munk. 
The results presented are Phases I-A and I-B results, which model steady-state and 
depletion in a 2D \gls{AHTR}, and multiphysics simulation results. 
I will use this analysis to underscore the complex modeling and simulation needed to 
adequately model this design. 

Chapter \ref{chap:rollo} describes the \acrfull{ROLLO} tool designed for this 
dissertation. 
\gls{ROLLO} is a Python package that applies evolutionary algorithm 
techniques to optimize nuclear reactor design. 
The motivation for \gls{ROLLO} is to enable reactor designers to utilize 
robust evolutionary algorithm optimization methods without going 
through the cumbersome process of setting up a genetic algorithm framework,
selecting appropriate hyperparameters, and setting up its parallelization. 
\gls{ROLLO} provides a general genetic algorithm framework, sets up 
parallelization for the user, and promotes usability with an input file 
that only exposes mandatory parameters.
I designed  \gls{ROLLO} to be effective, flexible, accessible, parallel, 
reproducible, and usable. 
\gls{ROLLO} is nuclear code-agnostic with no dependencies on  
nuclear software, and is hosted on Github \cite{chee_rollo_2021}. 

Chapter \ref{chap:method} describes the modeling and optimization methodology of the 
\gls{AHTR} plank and one-third assembly optimization for non-conventional 
geometries and parameters conducted using the \gls{ROLLO} software.
Because this is a proof of concept, I limit my approach to several key reactor 
parameters. 
I define and describe the \gls{AHTR} input parameters varied: \gls{TRISO} packing 
distribution, total fuel packing fraction, and coolant channel shape.
I define and motivate the key optimization objectives: minimizing fuel amount,
maximizing heat transfer, and minimizing power peaking.
I describe the \gls{AHTR} geometries, outline the \gls{AHTR} modeling workflow, 
verify the \gls{AHTR} models, and describe the process of tuning \gls{ROLLO}'s 
hyperparameters for the optimization problems.

Chapters \ref{chap:ahtr-plank-opt-results} and \ref{chap:ahtr-assem-opt-results} 
report the \gls{AHTR} plank and one-third assembly \gls{ROLLO} optimization results, 
respectively. 
I vary the following \gls{AHTR} plank and one-third assembly input parameters: 
\gls{TRISO} packing fraction distribution ($\rho_{TRISO}(\vec{r})$), total fuel 
packing fraction ($PF_{total}$), and coolant channel shape; in an effort to minimize 
the following objectives: total fuel packing fraction ($PF_{total}$), maximum 
temperature ($T_{max}$), and fuel-normalized power peaking factor ($PPF_{fuel}$). 
For each \gls{AHTR} geometry, I conduct six single objective, single input parameter 
\gls{ROLLO} optimizations to understand the individual impacts of each objective on 
each input parameter and inform the multi-objective optimization simulation setup. 
I conduct three two-objective \gls{ROLLO} optimizations and two three-objective 
\gls{ROLLO} optimizations for different numbers of input parameters based on the 
results from the single objective studies. 
I then investigate the driving factors for each objective and how their combined 
effects result in the optimal reactor models found by the multi-objective 
optimization simulations. 

Finally, Chapter \ref{chap:concl} provides general conclusions and discussion about 
future work.
