\section{AHTR Plank Optimization Results Discussion}
\label{sec:plank-discussion}
In this section, I conduct a deep-dive to understand the motivating factors for 
each individual objective, and how their combined effects result in the optimal 
reactor models found by the three-multi-objective optimization simulations. 

\subsection{Discussion: Minimize $PF_{total}$ Objective}
\label{sec:plank-discussion-pf}
\paragraph{Simulation p-1a}
For simulation p-1a, I conducted single-objective optimization 
simulations to minimize total fuel packing fraction ($PF_{total}$) by varying 
$PF_{total}$ and TRISO distribution. 
In simulation p-1a, \gls{ROLLO} found that an \gls{AHTR} plank model with a
$PF_{total}$ = 0.023 and oscillating TRISO distribution most-minimized 
$PF_{total}$ while meeting the $k_{eff} \geq 1.35$ constraint 
(Figure \ref{fig:slab-obj-1-pf}). 

I ran a simulation for constant $PF_{total}$ = 0.023 TRISO distribution and compared its 
fission reaction rate with the oscillating TRISO distribution 
to understand why the oscillating TRISO distribution enabled a lower $PF_{total}$. 
Figure \ref{fig:triso-0.023} shows the TRISO distributions for the two compared 
simulations: Figure \ref{fig:slab-obj-1-pf}'s most-minimized $PF_{total}$ 
and the constant $PF_{total}$ = 0.023.

    \label{fig:triso-0.023}
\end{figure}

Table \ref{tab:0.023-plank-fission-rate} compares the total fission reaction rate 
(OpenMC's \texttt{fission} tally) between the most-minimized $PF_{total}$ TRISO 
distribution and a constant $PF_{total}$ = 0.023 TRISO distribution (both shown in 
Figure \ref{fig:triso-0.023}).

\end{table}
In energy group 4, the most-minimized $PF_{total}$ TRISO distribution has $0.18\%$ higher  
\texttt{fission} (total fission reaction rate) than the constant 
$PF_{total}$ = 0.023 TRISO distribution, explaining why the oscillating TRISO 
distribution enabled a lower packing fraction for the same $k_{eff}$ compared to the 
constant TRISO distribution. 

\paragraph{Simulation p-1d}
For simulation p-1d, I conducted single-objective optimization 
simulations to minimize total fuel packing fraction ($PF_{total}$) by varying 
$PF_{total}$ and coolant channel shape. 
In simulation p-1a, \gls{ROLLO} found that there is no correlation 
between $PF_{total}$ and coolant channel shape (demonstrated in Figure 
\ref{fig:slab-obj-1-pf-final-coolant}). 

\paragraph{Summary}
The minimize $PF_{total}$ objective is driven by maximizing the fission reaction rates 
in the thermal energy group (Group 4). 
The minimize $PF_{total}$ objective has correlations with the following input parameters: 
$PF_{total}$ and TRISO packing fraction distribution. 
The objective has no correlation with coolant channel shape input parameter. 

\subsection{Discussion: Minimize $T_{max}$ Objective}
\label{sec:plank-discussion-temp}
\paragraph{Simulation p-1b}
For simulation p-1b, I conducted single-objective optimization 
simulations to minimize maximum plank temperature ($T_{max}$) by varying TRISO 
distribution. 
In simulation p-1b, \gls{ROLLO} found that an \gls{AHTR} plank model with a mostly 
flat TRISO distribution most-minimized $T_{max}$ 
(Figure \ref{fig:slab-obj-1-temp-final}).

I found that a fully flat \gls{TRISO} distribution results in a higher $T_{max}$.
Figure \ref{fig:slab-obj-1-temp-distr} compares the Moltres-generated centerline 
temperature distribution for the plank with mostly flat (Figure 
\ref{fig:slab-obj-1-temp-final}) and flat TRISO distributions for the same 
$PF_{total}$ = 0.0979. 
\begin{figure}[htbp!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{slab-obj-1-temp-distr.png}
    \caption{Comparison of Moltres-generated AHTR plank temperature distribution for 
    non-flat and flat TRISO distribution. 
    Both models have $PF_{total}$ = 0.0979.}
    \label{fig:slab-obj-1-temp-distr}
\end{figure}
The \gls{AHTR} plank with a flat \gls{TRISO} distribution has higher plank temperatures 
on the left and right sides near the moderator. 
To combat this temperature peak, ROLLO found a \gls{TRISO} distribution that 
has a slight dip near the moderator regions, resulting in a lower $T_{max}$.

\paragraph{Simulation p-1e}
For simulation p-1e, I conducted single-objective optimization 
simulations to minimize maximum plank temperature ($T_{max}$) by varying coolant 
channel shape. 
In simulation p-1e, \gls{ROLLO} found that there is a negative linear correlation 
between the plank's $T_{max}$ and total radius. 
Comparison of simulation p-1b and p-1e's results in 
Figures \ref{fig:slab-obj-1-temp-evol} and \ref{fig:slab-obj-1-temp-evol-coolant} 
show that coolant channel shape variation does not have as high of an impact on 
$T_{max}$ as \gls{TRISO} distribution variation: the average $T_{max}$ due to 
\gls{TRISO} variation decreased by 60K over 10 generations, while average $T_{max}$ due 
to coolant channel shape variation only decreased by 15K over 10 generations. 

\paragraph{Summary}
The minimize $T_{max}$ objective has correlations with all the input parameters: 
$PF_{total}$, TRISO packing fraction distribution, and coolant channel shape. 
The results from simulation p-1b and p-1e suggest that the objective is more heavily 
influenced by the TRISO distribution than the coolant channel shape. 

\subsection{Discussion: Minimize $PPF_{fuel}$ Objective}
\label{sec:plank-discussion-ppf}
In an effort to understand the motivating factors for the minimize $PPF_{fuel}$ 
objective, I conduct an equation analysis in Section
\ref{sec:plank-discussion-ppf-equation} to determine the \gls{AHTR} plank properties 
that influence $PPF_{fuel}$. 
I also demonstrate the derived relationship in simulation p-1c and p-2b's results. 

\subsubsection{Equation Analysis}
\label{sec:plank-discussion-ppf-equation}
Equation \ref{eq:reaction-rate-fission} shows the relationship between fission reaction 
rate, flux, and material properties: 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:reaction-rate-fission}
    RR_f &= \Phi \times \sigma_f \times N \\
\intertext{where}
    RR_f &= \mbox{fission reaction rate } [reactions \cdot cm^{-3} \cdot s^{-1}] \nonumber \\
    \Phi &= \mbox{neutron flux } [neutrons \cdot cm^{-2} \cdot s^{-1}] \nonumber \\
    \sigma_f &= \mbox{microscopic cross section } [cm^2] \nonumber \\
    N &= \mbox{atomic number density } [atoms \cdot cm^{-3}] \nonumber 
\end{align}

Since microscopic cross section is constant for the same fuel material, I rearrange 
Equation \ref{eq:reaction-rate-fission} into Equation \ref{eq:reaction-rate-fission-prop}: 
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:reaction-rate-fission-prop}
    \Phi \propto \frac{RR_f}{N}
\end{align}
In Section \ref{sec:ahtr_slab_output}, I defined the fuel-normalized power peaking 
factor ($PPF_{fuel}$) as: 
\begin{align}
    PPF_{fuel} &= max(\frac{fqr_j}{PF_j}) \div ave(\frac{fqr_j}{PF_j})
\intertext{where}
PPF_{fuel} &= \mbox{fuel-normalized power peaking factor} \nonumber \\
j &= \mbox{discretized fuel area j} \nonumber \\
fqr_j &= \mbox{fission-q-recoverable at position j (OpenMC tally)} \nonumber \\
PF_j &= \mbox{fuel packing fraction at position j} \nonumber
\end{align}
The fission reaction rate ($RR_f$) is proportional to fission energy production rate 
($fqr$). 
The atomic number density (N) is proportional to the fuel packing fraction ($PF$). 
Thus, I can further rearrange Equation \ref{eq:reaction-rate-fission-prop} into 
Equation \ref{eq:flux-prop-fqr}:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:flux-prop-fqr}
    \Phi_j \propto \frac{fqr_j}{PF_j}
\end{align}
Finally, I can further rearrange into Equation \ref{eq:flux-prop-ppf}:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:flux-prop-ppf}
    max(\Phi_j) \div ave(\Phi_j) &\propto max(\frac{fqr_j}{PF_j}) \div ave(\frac{fqr_j}{PF_j}) \nonumber \\
    &\propto PPF_{fuel}
\end{align}

Therefore, from Equation \ref{eq:flux-prop-ppf}, a flatter flux (smaller 
$max(\Phi_j) \div ave(\Phi_j)$ value) will result in a smaller $PPF_{fuel}$. 
Specifically, flatter energy group 4 thermal flux results in a smaller $PPF_{fuel}$
(see Table \ref{tab:fission-flux}). 
Table \ref{tab:fission-flux} shows the percentage contributions of fission reactions from 
each energy group. 
\begin{table}[htbp!]

    \onehalfspacing
    \caption{Percentage of fission reactions from each energy group for \gls{AHTR} plank model.}

    \textbf{Energy Group} & \textbf{Energy Bounds [MeV]} & \textbf{Percentage of Total Fission Reactions [\%]} \\

    4 & $1.0000\times 10^{-12} < E < 1.8554\times 10^{-6}$ & 90.14 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Most fission reactions are occurring in energy group 4. 

In the following section, I demonstrate Equation \ref{eq:flux-prop-ppf}'s relationship 
in simulation p-1c and p-2b's results. 

\subsubsection{Results Analysis}
\label{sec:plank-discussion-ppf-results}

\paragraph{Simulation p-1c}
For simulation p-1c, I conducted single-objective optimization 
simulations to minimize fuel-normalized power peaking factor ($PPF_{fuel}$) by varying 
TRISO distribution. 
In simulation p-1c, \gls{ROLLO} found that for $PF_{total}$ = 0.0979, an \gls{AHTR} 
plank model with TRISO distribution that peaks near the edges of the fuel region of 
the plank and a minimum point in center of the plank with a variation of $\sim0.07$, 
most-minimized $PPF_{fuel}$. 

I ran a simulation for constant $PF_{total}$ = 0.0979 and compared its 
flux to simulation p-1c's most-minimized $PPF_{fuel}$ TRISO distribution to understand 
why the latter enabled a lower $PPF_{fuel}$. 
Figure \ref{fig:triso-0.0979} shows the TRISO distributions with their $PPF_{fuel}$ 
values for the two compared simulations: Figure \ref{fig:slab-obj-1-ppf}'s 
most-minimized $PPF_{fuel}$ TRISO distribution and the constant $PF_{total}$ = 0.0979 
TRISO distribution.

    \label{fig:triso-0.0979}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:flux-comparison-0.0979-plank} compares the flux distributions between 
the most-minimized $PPF_{fuel}$ TRISO distribution and the constant $PF_{total}$ = 0.0979 
TRISO distribution (both shown in Figure \ref{fig:triso-0.0979}).

    \label{fig:flux-comparison-0.0979-plank}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:flux-comparison-0.0979-plank}, the constant distribution's Group 4 
flux dips in the center of the plank due to spatial self-shielding effects. 
In the Group 1 flux distribution, there is a peak in fast neutrons born in the plank's 
center, they are moderated in the graphite matrix and graphite structure 
(Figure \ref{fig:straightened_plank}). 
The self-shielding neutrons are more likely absorbed at the plank's sides, near 
the pure graphite structure moderating regions. 
The outer sides of the plank geometrically shield the plank's center from neutron 
flux, leading to a relatively lower group 4 thermal flux in the plank's center for 
the constant distribution. 

Table \ref{tab:flux-comparison-0.0979-plank} quantifies the flux comparison 
from Figure \ref{fig:flux-comparison-0.0979-plank} between simulation p-1c's 
most-minimized $PPF_{fuel}$ TRISO distribution and the constant 
$PF_{total}$ = 0.0979 TRISO distribution (both shown in Figure \ref{fig:triso-0.0979}).

    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In Energy group 4, the most-minimized $PPF_{fuel}$ flux distribution is $3.96\%$ flatter 
than the constant $PF_{total}$ = 0.0979 flux distribution, resulting in a lower 
$PPF_{fuel}$. 

\paragraph{Simulation p-2b}
For simulation p-2b, I conducted two-objective optimization 
simulations to minimize fuel-normalized power peaking factor ($PPF_{fuel}$) and total 
fuel packing fraction ($PF_{total}$) by varying TRISO distribution. 
In simulation p-2b, ROLLO found that the TRISO distribution with the most-minimized 
$PPF_{fuel}$ has $PF_{total}$ = 0.0029 and a TRISO distribution that peaks in the 
center of the plank and both sides, with a variation of $\sim0.02$.
This distribution differs from simulation p-1c's most-minimized $PPF_{fuel}$ TRISO 
distribution (Figure \ref{fig:slab-obj-1-ppf-final}) which has a large $\sim 0.07$ 
variation in TRISO distribution. 

I ran a simulation for constant $PF_{total}$ = 0.029 and compared its 
flux to simulation p-2b's most-minimized $PPF_{fuel}$ TRISO distribution to understand 
why the latter enabled a lower $PPF_{fuel}$. 
Figure \ref{fig:triso-0.0292} shows the TRISO distributions with 
their $PPF_{fuel}$ values for the two compared 
simulations: Figure \ref{fig:slab-obj-2-pfppf}'s most-minimized $PPF_{fuel}$
TRISO distribution and the constant $PF_{total}$ = 0.029 TRISO distribution..

\end{table}

In energy group 4, the most-minimized $PPF_{fuel}$ flux distribution is $0.28\%$ flatter 
than the constant $PF_{total}$ = 0.0292 flux distribution, resulting in a lower 
$PPF_{fuel}$. 
In the previous section, simulation p-1c's most-minimized $PPF_{fuel}$ flux 
distribution is $3.96\%$ flatter than the constant $PF_{total}$ = 0.0979 flux 
distribution with $\sim 0.07$ variation in TRISO distribution. 
This contrasts with simulation p-2b's $\sim 0.02$ variation in TRISO distribution. 
Higher $PF_{total}$ in simulation p-1c means that there is more fuel, resulting in 
more self-shielding effects. 
This results in TRISO distribution variation having a stronger effect in neutralizing 
self-shielding. 

\paragraph{Simulation p-1f}
For simulation p-1f, I conducted single-objective optimization 
simulations to minimize fuel-normalized power peaking factor ($PPF_{fuel}$) by varying 
coolant channel shape.
Comparison of simulation p-1c and p-1f's results in Figures 
\ref{fig:slab-obj-1-ppf-evol-coolant} and \ref{fig:slab-obj-1-ppf-evol}
show that coolant channel shape variation barely has an impact on $PPF_{fuel}$ as 
\gls{TRISO} distribution variation: the average $PPF_{fuel}$ due to \gls{TRISO} 
variation decreased by 0.1 over 10 generations, while average $PPF_{fuel}$ due to 
coolant channel shape variation only decreased negligibly over 10 generations. 
Figure \ref{fig:slab-obj-1-ppf-final-coolant} reiterates that there is no correlation 
between total radius and $PPF_{fuel}$. 

\paragraph{Summary}
The minimize $PPF_{fuel}$ objective is driven by flattening thermal (Group 4) flux. 
The minimize $PPF_{fuel}$ objective has correlations with the following input parameters: 
$PF_{total}$ and TRISO packing fraction distribution. 
The objective has no correlation with coolant channel shape input parameter.

\subsection{Discussion: Multi-Objective Optimization}
\gls{ROLLO} successfully finds widely spread solutions in each of the multi-objective 
optimization final generation's Pareto fronts.
In this section, I explain how the motivating factors and phenomena observed in 
the previous single-objective discussions (Sections 
\ref{sec:plank-discussion-pf}, \ref{sec:plank-discussion-temp}, and 
\ref{sec:plank-discussion-ppf}) combine to result in the optimal reactor models found 
by the multi-objective optimization simulations.

%\gls{ROLLO} is a global search of a large design space and helps narrow down possible 
%solutions.
%This informs reactor designers of optimal reactor parameters for their defined objectives.  
%From here, reactor designers can conduct sensitivity analysis and use high fidelity
