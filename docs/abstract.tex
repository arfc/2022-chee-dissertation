% A brief statement of the motivations and/or issues associated with the research 
% what problem did you study and why is it important? 
Additive manufacturing of reactor core components removes the geometric constraints
required by conventional manufacturing, such as slabs as fuel planks and cylinders 
as fuel rods, enabling further optimization and improvement of core geometries. 
Wide-spread adoption of additive manufacturing methods in the nuclear industry 
could drastically decrease reactor fabrication costs, reduce deployment timelines, 
and improve reactor safety. 
Fully benefitting from the new ability to 3D print reactor components requires further 
research into reactor generative design optimization. 
Generative reactor design optimization for arbitrary geometries enabled by additive 
manufacturing is a new concept, and few research demonstrations have been done to 
explore the large new design space. 

% A short description of the methods used. 
% what methods did you use?
In this dissertation, I apply evolutionary algorithms to conduct generative \gls{AHTR} 
design optimization. 
First, I participated in the \gls{OECD} \gls{NEA} \gls{FHR} benchmark to further our 
understanding of the \gls{AHTR} design's complexities.  
Next, I created the \gls{ROLLO} Python package tool that enables nuclear reactor design 
evolutionary algorithm optimization for non-conventional reactor geometries and fuel 
distributions. 
I then applied \gls{ROLLO} to conduct generative \gls{AHTR} design optimization.
\gls{ROLLO} generated \gls{AHTR} designs with varying fuel amounts, fuel 
distributions, and coolant channel shapes that optimize for three key reactor 
performance metrics: minimize total fuel amount, maximize heat transfer, and 
minimize power peaking.

% A summary of key results obtained 
% what were your principal results? 
This dissertation reported the \gls{FHR} benchmark Phase I-A and I-B results. 
Comparison of $k_{eff}$ results between the reference case and the \gls{AHTR} 
configuration with high heavy metal loading demonstrated that increased fuel 
packing does not always correspond with increased $k_{eff}$ due to self-shielding 
effects.
The \gls{AHTR} multiphysics model demonstrated that the temperature distribution 
peaked in the fuel stripes near the spacers, highlighting to reactor designers that 
spacer material and location in the \gls{AHTR} geometry impact temperature peaks.  
This dissertation reported the \gls{AHTR} plank and one-third assembly optimization 
results
