\section{AHTR One-Third Assembly Optimization Results Discussion}
\label{sec:assem-discussion}
Chapter \ref{chap:ahtr-plank-opt-results} characterized the driving factors for 
each reactor optimization objective and their relationship with one another for the 
\gls{AHTR} plank model. 

conduct a deep-dive to understand the driving factors for 
each individual objective, and how their combined effects result in the optimal 
reactor models found by the multi-objective optimization simulations. 

\subsection{Discussion: Minimize $PF_{total}$ Objective}
\label{sec:assem-discussion-pf}
\paragraph{Simulation a-1a}
In Section \ref{sec:assem-1-obj-pf}'s simulation a-1a, I conducted a single-objective 
optimization simulation to minimize the one-third assembly's total fuel packing fraction 
($PF_{total}$) by varying $PF_{total}$ and TRISO distribution.
