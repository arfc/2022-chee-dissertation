\section{AHTR One-Third Assembly Optimization Results Discussion}
\label{sec:assem-discussion}
Chapter \ref{chap:ahtr-plank-opt-results} characterized the \gls{AHTR} plank model's 
driving factors for each reactor optimization objective and their relationship with 
one another. 
In this section, I utilize the previous \gls{AHTR} plank characterizations and conduct 
a deep-dive to verify if the same reactor optimization objective driving factors apply 
to the \gls{AHTR} one-third assembly model. 
I also analyze how their combined effects result in the optimal reactor models found by 
the multi-objective optimization simulations. 

\subsection{Discussion: Minimize $PF_{total}$ Objective}
\label{sec:assem-discussion-pf}
\paragraph{Simulation a-1a}
In Section \ref{sec:assem-1-obj-pf}'s simulation a-1a, I conducted a single-objective 
optimization simulation to minimize the one-third assembly's total fuel packing fraction 
($PF_{total}$) by varying $PF_{total}$ and TRISO distribution.
