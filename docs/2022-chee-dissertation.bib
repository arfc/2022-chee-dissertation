	abstract = {Genetic algorithms (GAs) are global optimization techniques inspired by the mechanisms of natural evolution. In many complex problems, GAs have demonstrated to overcome traditional techniques. The key for such success is the efﬁcient exploration of the search space obtained by maintaining diversity during the search process. In standard GAs, the crossover operator is the main responsible for exploration. Its function is to generate new candidate solutions (offspring) by exchanging information between existing ones (parents). In order to provide extra diversity, quite helpful when population is drifting to local optima, mutation operator is used. However, many times it is not able to avoid premature convergence to local optima (due to ‘‘genetic drift’’). More efﬁcient techniques, such as distributed approaches (island GAs) and niching techniques, have been proposed. Island Genetic Algorithms (IGAs) are able to delay efﬁciently (but not to avoid) the genetic drift. The advantages of this approach are the simplicity of implementation and the efﬁciency attained by parallel processing. Niching Genetic Algorithms (NGAs), by their turn, prevent genetic drift by the maintenance of subpopulations in the so-called ‘‘niches’’. However, the computational cost is considerably increased in relation to the canonical GA. Motivated by the advantages offered by both techniques, we investigated a hybrid approach e the Niched-Island Genetic Algorithm (NIGA). The NIGA was applied to a nuclear reactor core optimization problem and compared to previously used GA-based techniques. NIGA and NGA obtained the best results. The NIGA achieves results similar to those obtained by the NGA, but in far less processing time.},

In this paper, the preliminary neutronic and thermal-hydraulic analysis of the TMSR-SF is performed. The neutronic investigation is conducted by developing a validated 3-D model for the reactor with MCNP-4C. Core physics parameters of TMSR-SF including the effective multiplication factor, neutron ﬂux distribution, power density distribution, control system worth, reactivity coefﬁcients and kinetics parameters are obtained, which are used as input parameters for the thermal-hydraulic analysis of the TMSR-SF. The FHR Safety Analysis Code (FSAC) is extended to study the safety characteristics of the TMSR-SF by simulating four types of basic transient conditions including the unprotected loss of ﬂow (ULOF), unprotected overcooling (UOC), unprotected transient overpower (UTOP) and the combination of ULOF and UTOP. The results show that the concept design of TMSR-SF is an inherently safe design with no temperature limits exceeded in the analyzed transient conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
The fluoride salt cooled high temperature reactor (FHR) is a class of fission reactor designs that use liquid fluoride salt coolant, TRISO coated particle fuel, and graphite moderator. Heavy ion fusion (HIF) can likewise make use of liquid fluoride salts, to create thick or thin liquid layers to protect structures in the target chamber from ablation by target X-rays and damage from fusion neutron irradiation. This presentation summarizes ongoing work in support of design development and safety analysis of FHR systems. Development work for fluoride salt systems with application to both FHR and HIF includes thermal-hydraulic modeling and experimentation, salt chemistry control, tritium management, salt corrosion of metallic alloys, and development of major components (e.g., pumps, heat exchangers) and gas-Brayton cycle power conversion systems. In support of FHR development, a thermal-hydraulic experimental test bay for separate effects (SETs) and integral effect tests (IETs) was built at UC Berkeley, and a second IET facility is under design. The experiments investigate heat transfer and fluid dynamics and they make use of oils as simulant fluids at reduced scale, temperature, and power of the prototypical salt-cooled system. With direct application to HIF, vortex tube flow was investigated in scaled experiments with mineral oil. Liquid jets response to impulse loading was likewise studied using water as a simulant fluid. A set of four workshops engaging industry and national laboratory experts were completed in 2012, with the goal of developing a technology pathway to the design and licensing of a commercial FHR. The pathway will include experimental and modeling efforts at universities and national laboratories, requirements for a component test facility for reliability testing of fluoride salt equipment at prototypical conditions, requirements for an FHR test reactor, and development of a pre-conceptual design for a commercial reactor.},

The facility proposed in this paper would be a flexible platform for expanding the knowledge of fast spectrum neutron cross sections needed for next-generation fast reactor designs. The Fast Neutron Source (FNS) would be composed of both a fast and a thermal region to minimize the amount of uranium fuel and reduce overall material costs while maintaining flexibility for many potential fast neutron crosssection experiments. The FNS would be customizable and interchangeable down to 1 × 1 × 10-in.-volume sections. An optimal core design requires the adjustment of many factors to both reduce the cost and accurately reproduce the spectra of interest during an experiment. A genetic algorithm was developed to optimize this complex design problem while reducing design time and expert judgment. The genetic algorithm was able to vary multiple design factors in an unattended fashion from a random initial population of designs and arrived at a design comparable to an expertly designed assembly.},

	abstract = {Implicit in any engineering design is an underlying optimization problem, although the exact objective function to be optimized is rarely stated explicitly. Nuclear systems optimization is as old as the discipline of nuclear engineering. Advanced manufacturing in the nuclear industry has opened the door for the re-examination of optimization in a way in which it was not possible before, namely, determining the optimal geometry for a given objective function. A trivial example is the sphere as the shape that minimizes the volume (or mass) of bare fissile material in a critical configuration. However, the problem becomes less trivial under even the simplest of multiphysics considerations. In this work, we develop the solution methodology for finding the minimum volume geometric configurations under the multiphysics constraints of 1,500 pcm excess reactivity and maximum fuel temperature of 618°C under forced-flow cooling conditions. Constraining the solution geometry only to right cylinders, surprisingly yields two disjoint solution regions. Flat, wide (disk-like) cylinders and tall, narrow (rod-like) cylinders both satisfy the constraints and yield very similar minimal volumes. However, the ultimate pursuit of this work is truly arbitrary geometry.},

	abstract = {A module based optimization method using genetic algorithms (GA), and multivariate regression analysis has been developed to optimize a set of parameters in the design of a nuclear reactor. GA simulates natural evolution to perform optimization, and is widely used in recent times by the scientiﬁc community. The GA ﬁts a population of random solutions to the optimized solution of a speciﬁc problem. In this work, we have developed a genetic algorithm to determine the values for a set of nuclear reactor parameters to design a gas cooled fast breeder reactor core including a basis thermal–hydraulics analysis, and energy transfer. Multivariate regression is implemented using regression splines (RS). Reactor designs are usually complex and a simulation needs a signiﬁcantly large amount of time to execute, hence the implementation of GA or any other global optimization techniques is not feasible, therefore we present a new method of using RS in conjunction with GA. Due to using RS, we do not necessarily need to run the neutronics simulation for all the inputs generated from the GA module rather, run the simulations for a predeﬁned set of inputs, build a multivariate regression ﬁt to the input and the output parameters, and then use this ﬁt to predict the output parameters for the inputs generated by GA. The reactor parameters are given by the, radius of a fuel pin cell, isotopic enrichment of the ﬁssile material in the fuel, mass ﬂow rate of the coolant, and temperature of the coolant at the core inlet. And, the optimization objectives for the reactor core are, high breeding of U-233 and Pu-239 in desired power peaking limits, desired effective and inﬁnite neutron multiplication factors, high fast ﬁssion factor, high thermal efﬁciency in the conversion from thermal energy to electrical energy using the Brayton cycle, and high fuel burn-up. It is to be noted that we have kept the total mass of the fuel as constant. In this work, we present a module based (modular) approach to perform the optimization wherein, we have deﬁned the following modules: single fuel pin cell, whole core, thermal–hydraulics, and energy conversion. In each of the modules we have deﬁned a speciﬁc set of parameters and optimization objectives. The GA system (GAS), and RS together, play the role of optimizing each of the individual modules, and integrating the modules to determine the ﬁnal nuclear reactor core. However, implementation of GA could lead to a local minimum or a non-unique set of parameters, those meet the speciﬁc optimization objectives. The GA code is built using Java, neutronic analysis using MCNP6, thermal–hydraulics calculations using Java, and regression analysis using R.},

Its low operating pressure and large thermal margin offer attractive safety. However, its complex core design, in particular the double heterogeneity introduced by TRISO particles, as well as the presence of several moderating materials, require careful veriﬁcation and validation (V\&V) of the core physics modeling and simulation (M\&S) methods. Due to their ability to accurately simulate complex geometries and utilize continuous-energy nuclear data, Monte Carlo methods are used in this study to evaluate core physics phenomena and provide reference solutions for veriﬁcation of lower ﬁdelity methods. This work is focused on the FHR design with hexagonal fuel elements consisting of fuel plates (‘‘planks”), i.e., the Advanced High-Temperature Reactor (AHTR) developed by ORNL. The pebble-bed FHR design, PB-FHR, is not directly considered in this work, although the results of this study are relevant for PB-FHR as well. The SERPENT Monte Carlo code is selected and utilized to perform core physics analyses of an FHR fuel assembly. The issues investigated include detailed ﬁssion distribution, quantiﬁcation of certain approximations, study of neutron spectra in different material regions, and impact of graphite density, temperature, and scattering matrix data. This study contributes to V\&V of modeling and simulation methods for FHR.},

	abstract = {Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are the creative design of nuclear reactors that have received considerable attention in recent years. Since there is insufficient operational experience in SMRs, extensive research on these types of reactors may be needed to improve the current level of these systems performance. Also, one of the approaches which can help the enhancement of a reactor power is changing its fuel geometry. For this purpose, as well as decreasing the maximum fuel temperature in the reactors, the technology of annular fuels with the ability of internal and external cooling shows its importance. The nuclear SMRs with annular fuel which is cooled internally and externally has the potential to increase high power density while maintaining a sufficient safety margin. The benefit of the dual cooled annular fuel design is that heat can be transferred to the coolant at both the outer and inner channels. Hence, in this study, for the first time, dual cooled annular fuel in the Small Modular Reactors is considered and studied thoroughly. In this paper, neutronics and natural circulation parameters are calculated for an SMR with Annular Fuel which is cooled internally and externally, with changes of the internal radius. By analyzing the fuel internal radius changes in a specific range via the neutronics and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation codes, the effects of power peaking factor, effective multiplication coefficient and natural circulation parameters are investigated. For the purpose of data fitting, an artificial neural network is trained using the observed data. The input consists of different internal radiuses which yields to output consisting effective multiplication factor, power peaking factor and natural circulation parameters. The Optimal geometry of annular fuel is determined using the neural network by implementing the genetic algorithms based on these neutronics and natural circulation parameters. Finally, using a simulated optimal geometry in the hot channel by neutronics and CFD simulations, thermal–hydraulic and neutronics calculations are accomplished, and these parameters are compared with the conventional SMR which uses solid (conventional) fuel. One of the main results of the evaluation is that optimal internally and externally cooled fuel in the presented SMR has a satisfactory margin for the departure from nucleate boiling (DNB) and maximum fuel rod temperature relative to the solid fuel which is used in the conventional SMRs. Indeed, fuel center temperature of conventional SMR is much more than that of presented optimal SMR. Also, presented optimal geometry increases the core effective multiplication coefficient which leads to increase in the excess reactivity. Also, reduces total power peaking factor and improves natural circulation parameters compared to the conventional SMR.},

Does the reactor go solid as soon as the reaction stops, or does the decay heat keep it liquid for a while. If so, how long before it becomes liquid? That should be a simple analysis, but I don't know anything about thermal hydraulics…- An advantage of solid fuel is that the fission products are contained. A disadvantage, compared to liquid fuel, is that the burnup is limited by material properties of the fuel materials. (What is the burnup limit for the pebble in the FHR?)-  ‘denatured’  MEANS {\textless}20\% enrichment""" Advantageous characteristics of the basic molten-salt reactor include:1) a reactor in which a ‘liquid core’ can burn a variety of fuels: 233 UF4 , 235 UF4  or 239 PuF4. Fuel salt in the form of uranium fluoride or plutonium fluoride is dissolved in the molten salt coolant and undergoes fission in the reactor core.2) Since the fuel is already molten in the primary coolant, there is no possibility of fuel meltdown. The primary coolant, its fuel and fission products can be easily immobilised in the event of a reactor ‘scram’ due to the salt’s high freezing ({\textasciitilde}458°C) temperature and low vapour pressure (evaporation rate). In the event of an emergency shutdown, the coolant can be drained into separate sub-critical holding tanks.3) The fluoride salt is known as FLiBe; standing for Fluoride-Lithium-Beryllium. FLiBe has a melting temperature of {\textasciitilde}458°C and a boiling temperature of {\textasciitilde}1400°C. The primary coolant fuel salt has a molar composition of 70\% 7 LiF, 18\% BeF2  and a 12\% mixture of 235 UF4 , ThF4  and ZrF4 . The secondary coolant salt responsible for driving the turbine generators is composed of lithium fluoride and beryllium fluoride only and has a 2:1 lithium to beryllium ratio (Li2 BeF4 ).4) FLiBe has a similar volumetric heat capacity and a similar thermal conductivity compared to pressurized water. The higher boiling point and lower vapour pressure of FLiBe means MSRs operate at higher thermal efficiencies, and the ability to operate without pressurisation compared to current water-cooled PWRs.5) Unlike Na-K coolants of Fast Breeder Reactors, FLiBe will not violently react with water or burn in air.6) Since MSRs do not require a pressurised primary-containment or a large secondary containment building for steam capture as needed for PWRs, MSR reactor size and back-up safety systems can be reduced in volume and complexity.7) Costly PWR fuel-bundle fabrication is unnecessary for liquid fueled MSRs, reducing operational costs.8) With a molten core with liquid fuel, krypton and xenon poisons can be out-gassed and removed from the primary coolant during operation, avoiding the ceramic cracking and damage associated with UO2  pellet irradiation.9) A liquid fuel MSR works well when deployed in tandem with a reprocessing facility to maintain minimum fissile inventory in the core. Fuel reprocessing including refueling and waste removal can occur whilst the MSR remains at power (ie. on-the-fly reprocessing). Also, sufficiently low fission inventory in the salt can be maintained so that decay heat could be minimised after reactor shutdown.10) Since the primary cooling loop operates at a high temperature (700°C - 1000°C), it is possible to use Brayton cycle turbines that are compact and have the potential to deliver 45\% thermal-mechanical conversion efficiency.Challenges to be addressed for liquid-fuel molten salts reactors with FLiBe:1) the primary coolant loop will be highly radioactive due to fission products being in solution with the primary coolant salt. This will complicate maintenance procedures which would require the use of flushing salts and remote handling techniques.2) Beryllium is chemically toxic.3) lithium-7 must be +99.99\% pure and its isotopic separation from Lithium-6 is costly. Lithium 6 is unwanted for its transmutation into tritium upon neutron capture. The presence of tritium (an isotope of hydrogen) can degrade the structural integrity of the containment vessel.4) Close attention must be paid to the chemical composition of the salt to maintain a chemically reduced solution for deterring uranium out-precipitation. The out precipitation of uranium would lead to solid uranium depositing on the bottom of the reactor vessel, causing local hot spots that may affect the integrity of the primary containment vessel. One manner of control is to vary the mixture of UF4  to UF3  during operations to maintain a slight excess of fluorine molecules.5) As the fuel is burnt in the core, fission products will be produced. Each fission product and daughter decay products would react differently with the metal alloy containment vessel. More work needs to be done to understand the reaction between alloys and fission products.6) The benefit of having a primary coolant with a high melting point that will ‘freeze easily’ to immobilize waste could result in some operational challenges. Some areas of the reactor that loose heat easily – eg heat exchanger surfaces and long narrow tubing, must be sufficiently well designed so they don’t freeze over during reactor operation.7) FLiBe salts have the ability to maintain a liquid form up to 1400°C, allowing the possibility for very high temperature operations. The metallic alloys containing the liquid thus become the system’s weakest link. To exploit FLiBe’s advantages, new metallic alloys or non-metallics (eg. C-Si) resistant to both high temperatures and radiation need to be developed and qualified.Proponents of the MSR design often talk of using U-233, bred from thorium, as fuel. Characteristics of the thorium fuel cycle include:1) U-233 breeding by Th-232 neutron capture. Fast or thermal neutron capture by Th-232 produces Th-233 (halflife 22min) beta decaying to Pa-233 (half-life 27days) and beta decaying again to U-233 (half-life 1.59 x 105 years) following the Neptunium decay series.2) U-233 can be chemically separated from Pa-233 and Th-232 in contrast to costly U-235/U 238 isotopic separation.3) From a nuclear non-proliferation stand point using thorium / U-233 is preferable. The breeding of U-233 contains trace amounts of a hard-gamma emitter: Tl-208. This makes U-233 difficult to handle and easier to detect.4) The hard-gamma emitting decay products U-233 means they are difficult to handle and fabricate into dioxide pellet fuel. The use of U-233 is more straight-forward in MSRs which only require their dissolution in the primary coolant.5) The thorium fuel cycle produces less long-life radioactive waste compared to the U-235/U238 fuel cycle.6) Thorium reserves are plentiful; its relative abundance is 4 times that of natural uranium and has the potential to supply earth’s energy demands for thousands of years.},

	abstract = {The ENDF/B-VII.1 library is our latest recommended evaluated nuclear data file for use in nuclear science and technology applications, and incorporates advances made in the five years since the release of ENDF/B-VII.0. These advances focus on neutron cross sections, covariances, fission product yields and decay data, and represent work by the US Cross Section Evaluation Working Group (CSEWG) in nuclear data evaluation that utilizes developments in nuclear theory, modeling, simulation, and experiment. The principal advances in the new library are: (1) An increase in the breadth of neutron reaction cross section coverage, extending from 393 nuclides to 423 nuclides; (2) Covariance uncertainty data for 190 of the most important nuclides, as documented in companion papers in this edition; (3) R-matrix analyses of neutron reactions on light nuclei, including isotopes of He, Li, and Be; (4) Resonance parameter analyses at lower energies and statistical high energy reactions for isotopes of Cl, K, Ti, V, Mn, Cr, Ni, Zr and W; (5) Modifications to thermal neutron reactions on fission products (isotopes of Mo, Tc, Rh, Ag, Cs, Nd, Sm, Eu) and neutron absorber materials (Cd, Gd); (6) Improved minor actinide evaluations for isotopes of U, Np, Pu, and Am (we are not making changes to the major actinides 235,238U and 239Pu at this point, except for delayed neutron data and covariances, and instead we intend to update them after a further period of research in experiment and theory), and our adoption of JENDL-4.0 evaluations for isotopes of Cm, Bk, Cf, Es, Fm, and some other minor actinides; (7) Fission energy release evaluations; (8) Fission product yield advances for fission-spectrum neutrons and 14 MeV neutrons incident on 239Pu; and (9) A new decay data sublibrary. Integral validation testing of the ENDF/B-VII.1 library is provided for a variety of quantities: For nuclear criticality, the VII.1 library maintains the generally-good performance seen for VII.0 for a wide range of MCNP simulations of criticality benchmarks, with improved performance coming from new structural material evaluations, especially for Ti, Mn, Cr, Zr and W. For Be we see some improvements although the fast assembly data appear to be mutually inconsistent. Actinide cross section updates are also assessed through comparisons of fission and capture reaction rate measurements in critical assemblies and fast reactors, and improvements are evident. Maxwellian-averaged capture cross sections at 30 keV are also provided for astrophysics applications. We describe the cross section evaluations that have been updated for ENDF/B-VII.1 and the measured data and calculations that motivated the changes, and therefore this paper augments the ENDF/B-VII.0 publication [M.

	abstract = {Molten-salt breeder reactors (MSBR’s) are being developed by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory for generating low-cost power while extending the nation’s resources of fissionable fuel. The fluid fuel in these reactors, consisting of UF4 and ThF4 dissolved in fluorides of beryllium and lithium, is circulated through a reactor core moderated by graphite. Technology developments over the past 20 years have culminated in the successful operation of the 8-MW(th) MoltenSalt Reactor Experiment (MSRE), and have indicated that operation with a molten fuel is practical, that the salt is stable under reactor conditions, and that corrosion is very low. Processing of the MSRE fuel has demonstrated the MSR processing associated with high-performance converters. New fuel processing methods under development should permit MSR’s to operate as economical breeders. These features, combined with high thermal efficiency (44\%) and low primary system pressure, give MSR converters and breeders potentially favorable economic, fuel utilization, and safety characteristics. Further, these reactors can be initially fueled with 233U, 235U, or plutonium. The construction cost of an MSBR power plant is estimated to be about the same as that of light-water reactors. This could lend to power costs 0.5 to 1.0 mill/kWh less than those for light-water reactors. Achievement of economic molten-salt breeder reactors requires the construction and operation of several reactors of increasing size and their associated processing plants.},

This study presents the need and effectiveness of adopting deep learning for generative design (or design exploration) research area. This work proposes an artificial intelligent (AI)-based deep generative design framework that is capable of generating numerous design options which are not only aesthetic but also optimized for engineering performance. The proposed framework integrates topology optimization and generative models (e.g., generative adversarial networks (GANs)) in an iterative manner to explore new design options, thus generating a large number of designs starting from limited previous design data. In addition, anomaly detection can evaluate the novelty of generated designs, thus helping designers choose among design options. The 2D wheel design problem is applied as a case study for validation of the proposed framework. The framework manifests better aesthetics, diversity, and robustness of generated designs than previous generative design methods.},

Motivated by the challenge to enable designers to easily develop meaningful input models of design intent to make best use of a structural generative method, this paper describes an initial combination of a generative design tool, eifForm, and an associative modeling system, Custom Objects, through the use of XML models. The current combined use is illustrated through an example involving generation of a set of 20 interrelated roof trusses with seven unique spans initiated by a parametric model of a saddle shaped stadium roof in Custom Objects. The paper concludes with a discussion of the synergies between associative modeling and generative systems and identifies future extensions aimed to exploit these synergies towards integrated performance-based generative design tools.},

	abstract = {Soft robotics is a growing field of research and one of its challenges is how to efficiently design a controller for a soft morphology. This paper presents a marine soft robot inspired by the ghost knifefish that swims on the water surface by using an undulating fin underneath its body. We investigate how propagating wave functions can be evolved and how these affect the swimming performance of the robot. The fin and body of the robot are constructed from silicone and six wooden fin rays actuated by servo motors. In order to bypass the reality gap, which would necessitate a complex simulation of the fish, we implemented a Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) directly on the physical robot to optimize its controller for travel speed. Our results show that evolving a simple sine wave or a Fourier series can generate controllers that outperform a hand programmed controller. The results additionally demonstrate that the best evolved controllers share similarities with the undulation patterns of actual knifefish. Based on these results we suggest that evolution on physical robots is promising for future application in optimizing behaviors of soft robots.},

Such systems make the computer a generative design tool and are already used extensively as a rapid prototyping technique in architecture and aeronautics. Combining a design generation tool with an analysis software and an evolutionary algorithm provides a methodology for optimising designs. This work combines NASA's parametric aircraft design tool (OpenVSP) with a ﬂuid dynamics solver (OpenFOAM) to create and analyse aircraft. An evolutionary algorithm is then used to generate a range of aircraft that maximise lift and reduce drag while remaining within the framework of the original design. Our approach allows the designer to automatically optimise their chosen design and to generate models with improved aerodynamic efﬁciency. Different components on three aircraft models are varied to highlight the ease and effectiveness of the parametric model optimisation.},

	abstract = {A generative CAD based design exploration method is proposed. It is suitable for complex multicriteria design problems where important performance criteria are uncomputable. The method is based on building a genotype of the design within a history based parametric CAD system and then, varying its parameters randomly within pre-defined limits to generate a set of distinctive designs. The generated designs are then filtered through various constraint envelopes representing geometric viability, manufacturability, cost and other performance related constraints, thus reducing the vast design space into a smaller viable design space represented by a set of distinctive designs. These designs may then be further developed by the designer. The proposed generative design method makes minimal imposition on the designer’s work process and maintains both flexibility and fluidity that is required for creative design exploration. Its ability to work seamlessly with current CAD based design practices from early conceptual to detailed design is demonstrated. The design philosophy behind this generative method and the key steps involved in its implementation are presented with examples.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the continuous energy coarse mesh transport code COMET was used to provide the whole core transport solution to a set of stylized Advanced High Temperature Reactor (AHTR) benchmark problems. This set includes two full length single assembly and three full core conﬁgurations. Solving this type of reactor core is a signiﬁcant challenge to high and low order neutron transport methods because of its high heterogeneities due to TRISO fuel and burnable absorber particles imbedded in graphite plates with Y-shaped control blades and molten salt as coolant. The eigenvalue and ﬁssion density distributions calculated by COMET were compared with the direct Monte Carlo solutions. In the single assembly calculations, it was found that eight-bin expansion in energy and 2nd order expansion in the other phase space variables used by COMET are sufﬁcient for calculation of the eigenvalue and the assembly averaged ﬁssion density distribution, while 4th order expansion in space is necessary to obtain the stripe-wise ﬁssion density distribution with accuracy comparable to that of the continuous energy Monte Carlo method. It was also found that it is impractical to use Monte Carlo to generate the detailed solutions (stripe-wise ﬁssion density distribution) to the full core benchmark problems because of the prohibitive computation resource requirement (estimated to be about 2200 days on an 84-CPU cluster). It took only about 4.5 h on a single CPU for COMET to calculate the detailed solution including the stripe-wise ﬁssion density distribution in the entire core. Given that COMET agreed very well with Monte Carlo in terms of assembly averaged and stripe-wise ﬁssion density distributions in the single assembly problems as well as in terms of the assembly averaged ﬁssion density distribution in the full core problems, it was concluded that the continuous energy COMET can provide the reference solution to the stylized AHTR benchmark problems.

This survey presents an overview of the fundamentals of artificial intelligence and the state of development of learning-based methods in nuclear science and engineering to identify the risks and opportunities of applying such methods to nuclear applications. This paper focuses on applications related to three key subareas related to safety and decision-making. These are reactor health and monitoring, radiation detection, and optimization. The principles of learning-based methods in these applications are explained and recent studies are explored. Furthermore, as these methods have become more practical during the past decade, it is foreseen that the popularity of learning-based methods in nuclear science and technology will increase; consequently, understanding the benefits and barriers of implementing such methodologies can help create better research plans, and identify project risks and opportunities.},

This paper presents an application of GAs as a relevance feedback method aiming to improve the document representation and indexing. In this particular form of GAs, various document descriptions compete with each other and a better collection indexing is sought through reproduction, crossover and mutation operations. In this paradigm, we are searching for the optimal balance between two genetic parameters: the population size and the number of generations. We try to discover the optimal parameter choice both by experiments using the CACM and CISI collections, and by a theoretical analysis providing explanation of the experimental results. The general conclusion tends to be that larger populations have better chance of signiﬁcantly improving the eﬀectiveness of retrieval.},

In this work, the heterogeneous effects of a collision of probability calculation method were used to represent the effects of scattering anisotropy on the leakage rates and the isotropic streaming effects due to low optical density in the model. The WIMS and DRAGON codes have been used to perform the calculations of double heterogeneity for the TRISO fuel, fuel compact, and fuel element and the results are compared with the SERPENT Monte Carlo code.},

Due to the two-region assumption of fuel kernel and graphite matrix in the original derivation of Williams’ method, which was developed to replace the time consuming SCALE continuous energy spectrum calculations with more efﬁcient equivalence theory and intermediate resonance approximation, the method can be applied only to the fuel kernels without coating layers. In order to overcome this limitation, Ji’s analytical expression of the Dancoff factor for multi-layer spheres has been incorporated into the DH method and the applicability has been successfully extended to the kernels with coating layers. It is demonstrated that the new method can predict the DH effects within 200 pcm order of errors against the reference Monte Carlo calculations for wide range of block type gas cooled reactor designs with coating layers.},

	title = {Random {Search} for {Hyper}-{Parameter} {Optimization}},
	abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efﬁcient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to conﬁgure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks conﬁgured by a pure grid search, we ﬁnd that random search over the same domain is able to ﬁnd models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search ﬁnds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising conﬁguration space. Compared with deep belief networks conﬁgured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional conﬁguration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for conﬁguring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent “High Throughput” methods achieve surprising success—they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

Optimization of the distribution of TRISO fuel particles can signiﬁcantly decrease the peak temperature, reducing the stress, and thus improve the safety and economy of the reactor. In this study, two optimization methods, namely octahedral and icosahedral-based segmentation optimization methods, were introduced to decrease the maximum temperature of the pebble fuel with packing fractions from 5\% to 40\%. ANSYS 19.1 was used to calculate the temperature distribution of pebble fuel elements with optimized and random TRISO particle distributions. The results showed that the optimization for the distribution of TRISO particles dispersed in the pebble fuel element is essential and feasible. The necessity and effectivity of optimization increase as packing fraction increases. The peak temperatures of the fuel pebbles with optimized TRISO particle distributions were signiﬁcantly decreased in comparison with the ones with randomly distributed TRISO particle. The icosahedral-based optimization method is recommended among the two kinds of optimization methods because the effectivity of the icosahedral-based optimization method is higher than the octahedral-based ones and the icosahedral-based optimization method can also get a higher target packing fraction.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an overview of Pronghorn, a multiscale thermal-hydraulic (T/H) application developed by Idaho National Laboratory and the University of California, Berkeley. Pronghorn, built on the opensource finite element Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE), leverages state-of-the-art physical models, numerical methods, and nonlinear solvers to deliver fast-running advanced reactor T/H simula­ tion capabilities within a modern software engineering environment. This work summarizes the physical models, multiphysics and multiscale coupling, and numerical discretization in Pronghorn with emphasis on our initial target application to pebble bed reactors (PBRs). A diverse set of applications are shown to depressurized natural circulation in the SANA experiments, forced convection in the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor, three-dimensional (3-D)/one-dimensional coupling of Pronghorn and RELAP-7 systems T/H for loop analysis in the High Temperature Reactor Power Module, and forced convection in the Mark-1 Pebble Bed Fluoride-Salt-Cooled HighTemperature Reactor. A multiphysics coupling of Pronghorn, RELAP-7, and Griffin deterministic neutronics for a gas-cooled PBR demonstrates the capability of the MOOSE framework for reactor design calculations. These applications highlight the verification and validation underlying Pronghorn’s software development while empha­ sizing features that improve upon capabilities offered by legacy tools in areas such as 3-D unstructured meshing, physics modeling, and multiphysics coupling.},

	abstract = {This is the twelfth electricity procurement plan (the “Plan,” “Procurement Plan,” “2020 Plan,” or “2020
Procurement Plan”) prepared by the Illinois Power Agency (“IPA” or “Agency”) under the authority granted to
it under the Illinois Power Agency Act (“IPA Act”) and the Illinois Public Utilities Act (“PUA”). Chapter 2 of this
Plan describes the specific legislative authority and requirements to be included in the plan, including those set
forth in previous orders of the Illinois Commerce Commission (“Commission” or “ICC”).
The Plan addresses the provision of electricity for the “eligible retail customers” of Ameren Illinois Company
(“Ameren Illinois”), Commonwealth Edison Company (“ComEd”), and MidAmerican Energy Company
(“MidAmerican”). Following MidAmerican’s participation for its fourth time in the 2019 IPA Procurement Plan,
MidAmerican has again elected to have the IPA procure power and energy for a portion of its eligible Illinois
customers through the 2020 Plan.1
As defined in Section 16-111.5(a) of the PUA, “eligible retail customers” are for Ameren Illinois and ComEd
generally residential and small commercial fixed price customers who have not chosen service from an
alternate supplier. For MidAmerican, eligible retail customers include residential, commercial, industrial, street
lighting, and public authority customers that purchase power and energy from MidAmerican under fixed-price
bundled service tariffs. The Plan considers a 5-year planning horizon that begins with the 2020-2021 Delivery
Year2 and lasts through the 2024-2025 Delivery Year.
The 2019 Procurement Plan, as approved by the Commission in Docket No. 18-1564, called for the energy
requirements for Ameren Illinois, ComEd, and MidAmerican to be procured by the IPA through two block
energy procurements (Spring 2019 and Fall 2019). In addition, the 2019 Plan included two capacity
procurements for Ameren Illinois (Spring 2019 and Fall 2019). The 2019 Procurement Plan also recommended
a continuation of the energy procurement strategies proposed in the 2018 Procurement Plan. This 2020
Procurement Plan recommends a further continuation of those strategies.
Renewable energy resources are now procured through procurements and programs subject to a separate
planning process. Those include procurements and programs described in the Long-Term Renewable
Resources Procurement Plan (“Long-Term Plan”) developed by the IPA and approved by the Commission on
April 3, 2018 in Docket No. 17-0838.
Section 16-111.5(b)(5)(ii)(B) of the PUA calls for that Long-Term Plan to be updated, and possibly revised,
every two years “in conjunction with the Agency's other planning and approval processes” to the extent
practicable. Concurrent with the release of the draft 2020 Procurement Plan, the Agency also released a draft
Revised Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan for public comment, and while the two plans will
be subject to separate written comment processes and will be filed separately with the Illinois Commerce
Commission, public hearings for receiving comment were jointly held},

Monte Carlo is increasingly cited as a reactor-agnostic approach to MGXS generation since it is unconstrained by the engineering-based approximations that limit the applicability of deterministic MGXS generation tools. This paper introduces a new framework that uses the OpenMC Monte Carlo code to generate MGXS for use in multigroup transport codes. The openmc.mgxs module is built atop OpenMC’s Python application programming interface to process tally data output by the OpenMC executable. This paper validates the module to generate MGXS that enable the multigroup OpenMOC transport code to compute eigenvalues to within 50 pcm and fission rates to within 1\% of reference solutions for two heterogeneous pressurized water reactor benchmarks.},

This method is applied to the analysis of uncertain Pareto frontiers in multi-objective optimization (MOO). The determination of the Pareto front of deterministic MOO is carried by minimizing the hypervolume contained between the front and the utopia point. We give some examples and we apply the approach to a truss-like structure for which conflicting objective functions such as the structure mass and the maximum displacement are both to be minimized.},

	abstract = {Genetic algorithm (GA) is an artiﬁcial intelligence search method that uses the process of evolution and natural selection theory and is under the umbrella of evolutionary computing algorithm. It is an efﬁcient tool for solving optimization problems. Integration among (GA) parameters is vital for successful (GA) search. Such parameters include mutation and crossover rates in addition to population that are important issues in (GA). However, each operator of GA has a special and different inﬂuence. The impact of these factors is inﬂuenced by their probabilities; it is difﬁcult to predeﬁne speciﬁc ratios for each parameter, particularly, mutation and crossover operators. This paper reviews various methods for choosing mutation and crossover ratios in GAs. Next, we deﬁne new deterministic control approaches for crossover and mutation rates, namely Dynamic Decreasing of high mutation ratio/dynamic increasing of low crossover ratio (DHM/ILC), and Dynamic Increasing of Low Mutation/Dynamic Decreasing of High Crossover (ILM/DHC). The dynamic nature of the proposed methods allows the ratios of both crossover and mutation operators to be changed linearly during the search progress, where (DHM/ILC) starts with 100\% ratio for mutations, and 0\% for crossovers. Both mutation and crossover ratios start to decrease and increase, respectively. By the end of the search process, the ratios will be 0\% for mutations and 100\% for crossovers. (ILM/DHC) worked the same but the other way around. The proposed approach was compared with two parameters tuning methods (predeﬁned), namely ﬁfty-ﬁfty crossover/mutation ratios, and the most common approach that uses static ratios such as (0.03) mutation rates and (0.9) crossover rates. The experiments were conducted on ten Traveling Salesman Problems (TSP). The experiments showed the effectiveness of the proposed (DHM/ILC) when dealing with small population size, while the proposed (ILM/DHC) was found to be more effective when using large population size. In fact, both proposed dynamic methods outperformed the predeﬁned methods compared in most cases tested.},

	abstract = {In the nuclear industry, a manufacturing-informed design approach has the potential to yield the most benefit from advanced manufacturing. By leveraging advanced materials, data science, and rapid testing and deploy­ ment, manufacturing-informed design can drive down costs and development times, ultimately improving future commercial viability. This approach is being demonstrated in the US Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy (DOE-NE) Transformational Challenge Reactor (TCR) program. Preconceptual design activities for TCR have been focused on analyzing and maturing four reactor core design concepts: two fast-spectrum and two thermal-spectrum systems. The designs were iteratively modified and analyzed, and subcomponents were manufactured in parallel over weeks instead of months or years. To meet key program initiatives (e.g., timeline and material use), several constraints—including fissile material availability, component availability, materials compatibility, and additive manufacturing capabilities—were factored into the design effort, yielding small cores less than one cubic meter in volume with near-term viability.},

This fuel particle offers signiﬁcantly higher uranium density over historic manifestations of coated fuel particles and may be more optimal for a range of advanced reactor applications. After reviewing the design process, steps involving production of this fuel form are discussed. Low burnup irradiation data on this fuel particle are now available, indicating that performance metrics have been met to date based on the original design expectations.},

	abstract = {Early cycle activities under the Transformational Challenge Reactor (TCR) program focused on analyzing and maturing four reactor core design concepts: two fast-spectrum systems and two thermal-spectrum systems. A rapid, iterative approach has been implemented through which designs can be modiﬁed and analyzed and subcomponents can be manufactured in parallel over time frames of weeks rather than months or years. To meet key program initiatives (e.g., timeline, material use), several constraints—including ﬁssile material availability (less than 250 kg of HALEU), component availabilities, materials compatibility, and additive manufacturing capabilities—were factored into the design effort, yielding small (less than one cubic meter in volume) cores with near-term viability. The fast-spectrum designs did not meet the ﬁssile material constraint, so the thermal-spectrum systems became the primary design focus. Since signiﬁcant progress has been made on advanced moderator materials (YHx) under the TCR program, gas-cooled thermal-spectrum systems using less than 250 kg of HALEU that occupy less than 1 m3 are now feasible. The designs for two of these systems have been evolved and matured. In both thermal-spectrum design concepts, bidirectional coolant ﬂow is used. Coolant ﬂows down through YHx moderator elements and is reversed in a bottom manifold and core support structure, and then ﬂows up though or around the fuel elements. The main difference between the two thermal-spectrum design concepts is the fuel elements—one uses traditional UO2 ceramic fuel, and the other uses UN-bearing TRISO fuel particles embedded inside a SiC matrix. Core neutronics and thermal performance for these systems are assessed and summarized herein.},

	abstract = {This paper will demonstrate the potential of modern design for additive manufacturing by using computational fluid dynamics with design optimization. The Transformational Challenge Reactor Instrumentation and Control (I\&C) Team has specifically requested that an instrumentation plane be designed for monitoring of the core-coolant-flow average temperature within ±5°C of the core outlet average temperature. However, because of systemwide constraints, this design space is allotted a pressure drop of only 0.5 psi. A successful design optimization study is discussed along with the thought process leading to the successful conclusion of an I\&C plane with an average temperature of 497.3°C and a standard deviation of 1.03°C, all while maintaining a 3.38-kPa (0.49-psi) pressure drop across the outlet plenum.},
